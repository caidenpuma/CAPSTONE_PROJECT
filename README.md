# CAPSTONE PROJECT

## Overview

This project implements a fully embedded soil monitoring system designed to simplify plant care through real-time environmental sensing and on-device feedback. SoilSense collects and displays data on moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity to help plant owners maintain optimal growing conditions. Unlike commercial solutions that rely on mobile app connectivity, SoilSense delivers actionable insights directly via an onboard LCD interface, offering a self-contained, user-friendly experience.

## Features

- Real-time sensing of soil moisture, ambient temperature, humidity, and light intensity
- Onboard LCD interface with plant-specific alert logic
- Configurable plant profiles for adaptive threshold monitoring
- LED indicator system for status and fault conditions
- Modular firmware architecture using STM32CubeIDE
- Designed for indoor plants up to 24" in diameter and depth
- Expandable architecture to support automated watering
